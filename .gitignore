# .gitignore Template
# The .gitignore file tells Git which files (or patterns) it should ignore and not track in version control. This helps keep your repository clean and free from unnecessary files.
# Below are some commonly used ones...

# Node.js specific ignores
# node_modules/ directory contains all the third-party libraries.
# You don't want to include these in your repository because they can be large,
# and they can be easily installed using `npm install`.
node_modules/

# Logs
# Log files can contain sensitive information and are not necessary for others
# to run your project.
logs/
*.log
npm-debug.log*

# Environment variables
# .env files often contain sensitive information like API keys and database passwords.
# These should not be committed to the repository.
.env

# Operating system specific files
# macOS stores metadata in these files which are not useful for others.
.DS_Store

# Windows system files
Thumbs.db
ehthumbs.db
Desktop.ini

# IDE/editor specific files
# Ignore configuration and metadata files generated by popular IDEs.
# These files are personal settings that don't need to be shared.
.vscode/
.idea/
*.suo
*.ntvs*
*.njsproj
*.sln

# Build/production directories
# These directories contain generated files (e.g., compiled code) which do not
# need to be version controlled.
dist/
build/
coverage/

# Miscellaneous
# Ignore other files or directories as needed.
*.bak
*.tmp
*.swp
